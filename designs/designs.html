            For this project for my interaction design class at Drexel I was tasked with redesigning the interaction flow for a mobile app.
            I chose the Dunkin mobile ordering app because of the simple interactions that I felt I could add a bit of juice to. I wanted to 
            retain a lot of the orginal style and structure from the original app while making the interactions a bit more interesting. I felt 
            like I was able to accomplish this goal with this project.

            For this assignment for my User Interface design class at Drexel University we were tasked with taking a 
            UI for a fighting game and redesigning it. I chose to redesign the UI for the original Street Fighter because I wanted
            to work with pixel art, despite never doing something like this before. For my redesign, I changed the colors of the health bars,
            moved the health bars to be more clear about which health bar belonged to each character, enlarged player names so that it would 
            be easier to read, moved the timer to the top of the screen so that there was no need to look down to know how much time was left 
            in the match, and moved the round victory counter so that it was more clear which player it belonged to. This was the first time 
            that I had ever tried doing a redesign for a game.

                The in game UI for Flower Power. I took heavy inspiration from Pokemon when making this. The hover on the different 
                actions are boxes. Health Points and Pollen, mana for this game, are both shown above each characterâ€™s head.

                The inventory system for Flower Power is called The Hive. The inventory is shaped like a hive to fit the theme of the game. 
                All of the stats are on the left displaying how much of each stat the character has.

            Flower Power is an original idea for a game that I had that I used for my User Interface I final. Flower Power is an RPG that was designed for 
            PC, that took heavy design influence from the original Game Boy. In Flower Power instead of using typical RPG weapons such as swords, shields, 
            and axes you use flowers to fight your enemies. Magic in this game uses pollen instead of mana, to fit the aesthetic of the game. I used this idea
            for the game for my User Interface I final, because I felt that I could be able to create a design that would best fit the original idea for this game.
