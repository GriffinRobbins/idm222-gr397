            Hello. my name is Griffin Robbins. I am currently a student at Drexel University studying Game Design and Production, with a minor in Interactive Digital Media. 
            At the age of twenty one I was asked what I wanted to be when I grow up. This question really stuck with me, because the answer to that is that I don't know specifically.
            I consider myself a technical generalist and a designer, but even with that in mind I am not certain what I really want to do with those skills.  
            Thank you for checking out my website and I hope you enjoy some of my work.
        </p>
