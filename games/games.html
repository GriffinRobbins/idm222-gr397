            Quantum Robbers is the first game that I have worked on. 
            What is Quantum Robbers? As of now, Quantum Robbers is a turned based three vs three capture the flag inspired board game 
            in which one team attacks an object and another team defends the objective. The two teams which consist of unique characters, 
            the Paradox Patrol, the defenders, and the Quantum Robbers, the attackers. Our team Virgin Mimosa Studios is working 
            with <a href="https://egs.excite.drexel.edu/" target="_blank">Drexelâ€™s Entrepreneurial Game Studio</a> to help develop our game. 
            At the moment we do not have a website available for our game but the Virgin Mimosa Twitter contains all updates for the game.

            Ragball is a two vs two competitive party pack consisting of two game modes. Ragball is a wacky spin on basketball where the player is the ball. 
            You throw your friends and your enemies in an attempt to throw your enemies into their own hoop. The other game mode Rag of the Hill is a take 
            on king of the hill in which players compete to climb to the top of a sandcastle to gain more points. The player with the most points wins. 
            For this project, I worked as the lead designer for Rag of the Hill.

            A Trebled Man came from the idea of trying to combine a stealth game with a rhythm game. This was a ten-week project consisting of a team of six for
            our Workshop class. I acted as producer for this game but also contributed to some of the programming and the art. Our team soon realized that we were 
            a bit over our heads with the game and did not meet the expectations that we had set for ourselves.

            Solely Basis is a packing simulator in which the user is given orders above boxes and have to pack the boxes with the correct orders. 
            This game was made for a two day game jam during the quarantine. For this project, I work on some of the game design and the level design.

            Rocket Science is a first person platform in which you use a rocket launcher to overcome obstacles. This game came my Game Development Foundations class at 
            Drexel University as a six week project, in which groups of four to five members were tasked with making a game. For this project, I worked mostly on 
            the UI, as that was my main role on the team, but I also developed the core mechanic of the rocket jumping.
